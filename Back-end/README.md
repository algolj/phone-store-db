## Server

---

**How to run the server?**

1. Use the command in the console: `npm i` this will install all dependencies to start the server (assuming Node.JS is already installed on your machine);
2. After which, write in the console: `npm run start`;
3. If after that the line 'Port: 4000' appeared in the console ... this thing works.

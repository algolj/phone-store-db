## Dump database

---

The database model is shown in the figure. Where the first column is the name of the column in the table, the second is fields datatype, and the third is the size of the field and whether it is a key.

#### Attention

- The database uses PostgreSQL specific data types. If you want to use a different DBMS, please fix them.
- Developed database is not the best design solution and was developed exclusively for the practice of working with the client-server architecture of the PERN stack with an analytical block on the back-end side.
